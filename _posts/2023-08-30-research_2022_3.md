### Abstract
This study aims to explore approaches for ESG factors in construction industry for administrative use by municipality. Accordingly, existing papers related to the ESG factors are analyzed. The result of this paper are summarized in four main approaches; 1) perceived economic burden of SMEs(Small and Medium-sized Enterprises), 2) sensitivity to injustice and corruption, 3) pursuing quantitative indicators, 4) global level orientation. It is expected that this study will contribute academically as a basic study for the ESG factors in construction industry for local government.
