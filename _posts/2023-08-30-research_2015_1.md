### Abstract
This paper conducted a network analysis of two BIM project cases — one a large-sized project and the other a small-sized project — using the Ucinet6 software program, aiming to identify BIM project success factors for collaboration according to organization size. The results show that the organization size and the knowledge of BIM experts have no influence on project performance or on the improvement of a network. Rather, as the centrality of a network increased and the closeness of participants decreased, construction was delayed. However, even if the centrality increased, the project was well performed when the possibility of structural holes was lower and density was higher.
