### Abstract
The aim of this research was to identify the factors influencing the adoption of facility management system (FMS) in higher education facilities from the perspective of innovation resistance. We conducted surveys at two universities: one utilizes FMS, the other is planning to adopt it. Respondents were classified into three groups depending on their experiences. The respondents favored business compatibility over ease of use. Abundant information directly influenced FMS satisfaction. We identified the respondentsâ€™ willingness and tendency to adopt innovation technology.
