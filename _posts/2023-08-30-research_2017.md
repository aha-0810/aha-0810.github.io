### Abstract
As the demand for personnel for building information modeling (BIM) projects has increased, a question regarding the job titles, duties, and qualifications for BIM-related personnel has become a critical issue for recruitment, promotion, and education purposes. To address this issue, 242 online job posts in English from the US, the UK, and China were collected and analyzed. First, 35 types of job titles and 5,998 terms were derived from the 242 job posts. Second, 35 types of job titles were classified into eight BIM jobs by analyzing the relations between job titles using the role and position analysis of the social network analysis. Third, the 5,998 terms were categorized into 43 competency elements based on the O*NET job competency classification. Fourth, the 43 competencies were subcategorized into common competencies and job-specific competencies for eight BIM jobs. Based on the findings, the implications for BIM education, training, and employment are discussed.
