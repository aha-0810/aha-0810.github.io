### Abstract
This paper analyzes the building information modeling (BIM) and drawing-based design review capability of experienced practitioners through a survey, experiments, and a case study. The survey of 54 experienced practitioners shows that experienced practitioners believe that architects with over 20 years of experience may find about a half (49.2%) of the design errors in the drawings related to a specific floor in two to three hours. However, four error -detection experiments with eight experienced practitioners confirms that the number of  design errors that experienced practitioners can detect is far lower (below 5%) than what has been generally believed. A subsequent case study shows that clashes between building elements in particular were rarely detected until BIM was introduced into the project, even when a design review checklist was used during drawing-based design review. This study may act as a catalyst to overcome practitionersâ€™ resistance to BIM.
